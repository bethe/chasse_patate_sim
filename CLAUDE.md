# CLAUDE.md

## Project Overview

Chasse Patate — a cycling board game balance simulator. Runs thousands of AI-vs-AI games to detect dominant strategies and balance issues.

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3
- **Dependencies:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib (see `requirements.txt`)

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running

```bash
# Quick balance test (10-50 games, shows win rates)
python quick_test.py

# Generate analysis report from existing game logs
python generate_report.py

# Usage examples and tutorials
python example_usage.py

# Play interactively against bots
python play.py

# Run comprehensive unit tests for all game rules
python test_game_rules.py
```

## Project Structure

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `game_state.py` | Core data structures: cards, riders, players, board, El Patron rule |
| `game_engine.py` | Game rules, move validation, terrain limits |
| `agents.py` | AI agent implementations (14 strategies) |
| `simulator.py` | Game execution, logging, batch runs, tournaments |
| `analysis.py` | Statistical analysis and report generation |
| `quick_test.py` | Fast balance testing script |
| `generate_report.py` | Standalone report generator |
| `example_usage.py` | Usage examples |
| `play.py` | Interactive play against bots (terminal UI) |
| `test_game_rules.py` | Comprehensive unit tests for all game rules and mechanics |

Output goes to `game_logs/` (gitignored).

## Key Concepts

### Actions
- **Pull** (1-3 cards): Advance a single rider
- **Attack** (3 cards): Aggressive advance with bonus
- **Draft** (0 cards): Follow previous move (free movement)
- **TeamPull** (1-3 cards): One rider pulls, teammates draft
- **TeamDraft** (0 cards): Multiple riders draft together
- **TeamCar** (0 cards): Draw 2, discard 1

### Card Types
- **Energy** - Wild card, always moves 1
- **Rouleur** - Balanced movement
- **Sprinter** - Fast on flat/descent
- **Climber** - Strong on climbs

### Riders
- 3 riders per player (Rouleur, Sprinter, Climber)
- Each rider has terrain-specific strengths

### Terrain Limits (NEW)
Riders have maximum fields per round on certain terrain:
| Rider    | Terrain  | Max Fields |
|----------|----------|------------|
| Sprinter | Climb    | 3          |
| Rouleur  | Climb    | 4          |
| Climber  | Cobbles  | 3          |

Limits apply only to the portion of movement on limited terrain. In team moves, each rider applies their own limits individually.

### El Patron Rule
- El Patron rotates each round (Player 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> ...)
- Determines turn order when riders are tied at the same position
- El Patron player goes first among tied players

### Turn Order (Round-Based)
1. At round start, El Patron rotates (except round 1)
2. Riders move in order of position (leaders first)
3. When tied, El Patron order determines who moves first
4. Same player's different riders CAN draft each other
5. All riders must move once before a new round begins

### Game End Conditions
- 5 riders finish
- One player has all 3 riders at finish (NEW)
- Round limit (150) hit
- All cards run out

## Available Agents

14 agent types: `random`, `greedy`, `lead_rider`, `balanced`, `sprint_hunter`, `conservative`, `aggressive`, `adaptive`, `wheelsucker`, `gemini`, `claudebot`, `rouleur_focus`, `sprinter_focus`, `climber_focus`

### Featured Agents

**ClaudeBot** - Multi-factor scoring:
- Terrain-aware movement (uses terrain limits strategically)
- Sprint/finish targeting based on arrival order
- Card economy and hand management
- Drafting efficiency (free movement is valuable)
- Rider specialization (right rider for right terrain)

**Gemini** - Balanced scoring:
- Total advancement (distance x riders)
- Sprint/finish points potential
- Card efficiency (penalizes card usage)
- Checkpoint card drawing
- Hand management (TeamCar when needed)

## Code Conventions

- Dataclasses for all game entities (`Card`, `Rider`, `Player`, `Move`, etc.)
- Enums for constants (`CardType`, `TerrainType`, `ActionType`, `PlayMode`)
- Type hints on all function signatures and class attributes
- Abstract base class pattern for agents (`Agent` ABC -> concrete agents)
- `eligible_riders` parameter in `choose_move()` for round-based turns
- JSON for game logs, CSV for tournament results
- Comprehensive unit tests in `test_game_rules.py` (60+ tests covering all mechanics)

## Key Functions

### game_engine.py
- `TERRAIN_LIMITS` - Dict mapping (CardType, TerrainType) -> max fields
- `_calculate_limited_movement()` - Apply terrain limits field-by-field
- `get_valid_moves(player, eligible_riders)` - Get valid moves for eligible riders
- `execute_move(move)` - Execute a move and return results

### game_state.py
- `start_new_round()` - Begin new round, rotate El Patron
- `determine_next_turn()` - Get (player, eligible_riders) or None if round complete
- `mark_riders_moved(riders, position)` - Mark riders as moved
- `check_game_over()` - Check all end conditions

### agents.py
- `create_agent(agent_type, player_id)` - Factory function
- `get_available_agents()` - List all agent names
- All agents implement `choose_move(engine, player, eligible_riders)`

## Recent Changes

- Added terrain limits rule (Sprinter/Rouleur/Climber restrictions)
- Added El Patron rule (rotating turn order for tied positions)
- Added ClaudeBotAgent (terrain-aware multi-factor AI)
- Added GeminiAgent (balanced scoring AI)
- Round-based game loop (all riders move before new round)
- Same player's riders can draft each other
- Game ends when one player finishes all 3 riders
