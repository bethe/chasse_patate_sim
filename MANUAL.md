# Chasse Patate - Player Manual

## Quick Start for New Players

Welcome to Chasse Patate! This is a cycling race board game where you manage a team of 3 riders racing to the finish line.

## Objective

**Win by scoring the most points!** You earn points by:
- **Sprint points**: 3/2/1 points for 1st/2nd/3rd at the end of each tile (every 20 fields)
- **Finish points**: 12/8/5/3/1 points for the top 5 riders crossing the finish line

The game ends when 5 riders finish, or one player gets all 3 riders to the finish.

## Your Team

You control 3 riders, each with different strengths:

- **Rouleur** (🚴) - Balanced, good on all terrain
- **Sprinter** (🚴‍♂️) - Fast on flat and descents, weak on climbs
- **Climber** (🚴‍♀️) - Excellent on climbs, limited on cobbles

## The Track

The race consists of tiles (20 fields each) with different terrain:

- **Flat** (.) - Standard terrain
- **Cobbles** (~) - Rough terrain (Climbers limited to 3 fields/round)
- **Climb** (^) - Mountains (Sprinters limited to 3 fields/round, Rouleurs to 4)
- **Descent** (v) - Downhill (everyone goes fast!)
- **Sprint** [S] - Sprint points awarded here
- **Finish** [F] - Finish line

## Your Hand

You have cards in your hand that power your moves:

- **Energy** - Wild card, always moves 1 field on any terrain
- **Rouleur** - Balanced movement (2/1/1/3 on Flat/Cobbles/Climb/Descent)
- **Sprinter** - Fast on flat (1/1/0/3), great for attacking (3/2/1/3)
- **Climber** - Mountain specialist (0/0/2/3), powerful attacks on climbs (1/0/3/3)

## Actions You Can Take

On your turn, pick one action:

### 1. **Pull** (1-3 cards)
Move a single rider forward by playing 1-3 cards. The cards must match the rider type (or use Energy).

### 2. **Attack** (3 cards)
An aggressive move! Play exactly 3 cards (at least one must match the rider) for bonus movement. Great for sprints!

### 3. **Draft** (FREE!)
Follow the previous rider's move for free! You must start at the same position they started from. This is the most efficient action - use it often!

### 4. **TeamPull** (1-3 cards)
One rider pulls, and teammates at the same position draft behind. Everyone moves together!

### 5. **TeamDraft** (FREE!)
Multiple riders draft together from the previous move. Free movement for your whole team!

### 6. **TeamCar** (FREE!)
Draw 2 cards, discard 1. Use this when you're running low on cards or have bad cards.

## How Turns Work

Turns are **position-based** (not player-by-player):
- The furthest-forward riders move first
- When riders are tied at the same position, the **El Patron** player goes first
- El Patron rotates each round: Player 0 → Player 1 → Player 2 → ...
- All riders must move once before a new round begins

## Strategy Tips for Beginners

1. **Draft whenever possible** - Free movement is the best movement!
2. **Save your good cards** - Don't waste them on small moves
3. **Plan for sprints** - Position your riders to arrive 1st/2nd/3rd at tile ends
4. **Use the right rider** - Climbers on climbs, Sprinters on flats
5. **Team moves are powerful** - Moving multiple riders together is efficient
6. **Watch your hand** - Use TeamCar when running low on cards
7. **Terrain limits matter** - Sprinters can't climb far, Climbers struggle on cobbles

## Quick Example

**Situation:** Your Sprinter is at position 15 (flat terrain), you have 2 Sprinter cards.

**Options:**
- **Pull with 2 cards**: Move 1 field each = 2 fields forward (position 17)
- **Wait for a teammate** to move to position 15, then **Draft**: Move for FREE
- **Use TeamCar**: Draw 2 new cards if your hand is weak

**Best play?** If another rider just moved from position 15, Draft for free! Otherwise, consider if you want to save cards for the upcoming sprint at position 20.

## Drawing Cards

You draw cards automatically when crossing checkpoints:
- Every 10 fields (mid-tile checkpoints)
- Every 20 fields (new tile boundaries)

Default: 3 cards per checkpoint.

## Game End

The game ends when:
- 5 riders cross the finish line, OR
- One player gets all 3 riders to finish, OR
- A player gets stuck (no advancement for 5 rounds)

The player with the most points wins!
